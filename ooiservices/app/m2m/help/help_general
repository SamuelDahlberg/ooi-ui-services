M2M DocumentationSummary.The m2m interface provides registered OOI users programmatic access to uframerequests on specific ports for different request methods. This supports thediscovery and data management through numerous REST request types.The following chart identified which ports and request methods are currentlysupported through the m2m interface.Port    GET     POST    PUT     Permission Category                                 Required12575    x                                 Preload information (streams, etc.)12576    x                                 Sensor Inventory12577    x                                 Alerts and Alarms12578    x                                 Quality Control (QC)12580    x       *       *     annotation  Annotations12586    x                                 Vocabulary12587    x                                 Asset Management Subsystem (includes assets, events, status,                                           deployments, cruises)* indicates Permission is required for these request methods.For a request to be valid, the user must also have permission to participate in the rolesrequired for the request. For instance, to perform POST and PUT requests on port 12580,a user must have permission to work with annotations. Note, permissions are provided bythe OOI System administrator and requests should be directed to the OOI help desk.Structure of an M2M Request.M2M requests are issued programatically and require valid OOI user credentials.The general syntax for an m2m request is:   http://server/api/m2m/requestwhere the values are:server    the OOI UI server you wish to interact with to process your request.api/m2m   constant value indication we are requesting an m2m api request. (Always set to 'api/m2m')request   is a two part string consisting of 'port/url'How to use M2M Help Documentation.To obtain information about the uframe queries available on any given port, use one of the followingm2m requests to receive additional help information by port number:http://server/api/m2m/help/12575     Preload information (streams, parameters, etc.)http://server/api/m2m/help/12576     Sensor Inventoryhttp://server/api/m2m/help/12577     Alerts and Alarmshttp://server/api/m2m/help/12578     Quality Control (QC)http://server/api/m2m/help/12580     Annotationshttp://server/api/m2m/help/12586     Vocabularyhttp://server/api/m2m/help/12587     Asset Management Subsystem
